(* OCaml's abstract syntax tree evolves with time. We depend on this tree
   because we analyze it (that is, we analyze type definitions) and because we
   construct it (that is, we generate code). This module was initially created
   to gather the ugly bits whose definition varies depending on the version of
   OCaml that we are working with. That said, since we have switched to using
   ppxlib, my understanding is that we always work with the latest version of
   the AST. More precisely, the version of the AST that we get no longer
   depends on which OCaml compiler we are using; it depends on which version
   of ppxlib we are using. At the time of writing, we depend on ppxlib 0.9.0
   or newer, which implies that we get an AST for OCaml 4.08 or newer. See
   https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/blob/master/CHANGES.md *)
